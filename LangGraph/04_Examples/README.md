## Contributing:

To add new examples to this folder:

1. Create a descriptive folder name
2. Include a README.md explaining the example
3. Provide both notebook (.ipynb) and script (.py) versions
4. Include setup instructions and prerequisites
5. Add example usage and expected outputs

## Example Structure:

```

```

## Getting Started:

1. Browse existing examples in subfolders
2. Read the README.md in each example folder
3. Follow setup instructions
4. Run the example notebooks or scripts
5. Modify and experiment with the code

## Best Practices:

- **Documentation**: Always include comprehensive README files
- **Dual Format**: Provide both notebook and script versions
- **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling
- **Configuration**: Use environment variables for API keys
- **Examples**: Include sample data and expected outputs
- **Comments**: Add clear comments explaining the code
